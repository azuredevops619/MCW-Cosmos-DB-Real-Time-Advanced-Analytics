# Real-time advanced analytics before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription, must be a pay-as-you-go subscription).
2. **IMPORTANT**: To complete the OAuth 2.0 access components of this hands-on lab you must have permissions within your Azure subscription to create an App Registration and service principal within Azure Active Directory.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

In the Before the hands-on lab exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the hands-on lab section to prepare your environment **before attending** the hands-on lab. Failure to do so will significantly impact your ability to complete the lab within the time allowed.

> **Important**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout this lab you will see the word “SUFFIX” as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

### Task 1: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

In this task, you create an Azure resource group to serve as a container for the resources used throughout this lab.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups are highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. On the Resource groups blade, select **+Create**.

   ![+Add is highlighted in the toolbar on Resource groups blade.](media/resource-groups-add.png "Resource groups")

3. On the Create a resource group **Basics** tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription (1)**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group (2)**: Enter **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** as the name of the new resource group.
   - **Region (3)**: Select the region you are using for this hands-on lab.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Create a resource group Basics tab.](media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

4. Select **Review + Create (4)**.

5. On the **Review + create** tab, ensure the Validation passed message is displayed and then select **Create**.

### Task 2: Deploy Environment

1. Deploy the workspace through the following Azure ARM template (press the button below):

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fazuredevops619%2FMCW-Real-Time-Advanced-Analytics%2Fmain%2FHands-on%2520lab%2FDeployment%2Fenvironment-template.json
" target="_blank"><img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton" /></a>

2. Enter the following values, then select **Review + create**:

   - Resource group: **Select the Resource Group created previously for the lab**.
   - Unique Suffix: **Enter a unique value, such as your initials followed by birth year**.
   - Autoscale Max Throughput: **Enter 4000 as the max RU/s for the Azure Cosmos DB containers**.
   - Vm Username: **Accept the default value, `demouser`**.
   - Vm Password: **Accept the default value, `Password.1!!` (or change to a different one)**.

   ![The parameters specified are highlighted.](media/deploy-deployment-parameter-fields.png 'The parameters specified are highlighted')

3. Select **Create** on the `Review + create` form.

    ![The review page is displayed.](media/deploy-review.png "Review + create")

4. The deployment will take approximately 15 - 20 minutes to complete.

    ![The deployment progress is shown.](media/deploy-deployment-progress.png 'The deployment progress is shown')

### Task 3: Set the default web browser to Microsoft Edge on the Lab VM

In this task, you create an RDP connection to your Lab virtual machine (VM) and change the default web browser to Microsoft Edge. This will ensure Microsoft Edge is used when launching a web browser from Visual Studio and prevent the functionality issues encountered if using Internet Explorer.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. Select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group from the list.

   ![The "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX" resource group is highlighted.](./media/resource-groups.png "Resource groups list")

3. In the list of resources within your resource group, select the **LabVM Virtual machine** resource.

   ![The list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group are displayed, and LabVM is highlighted.](./media/resource-group-resources-labvm.png "LabVM in resource group list")

4. On your LabVM blade, select **Connect** and **RDP** from the top menu.

   ![The LabVM blade is displayed, with the Connect button highlighted in the top menu.](./media/connect-vm-rdp.png "Connect to Lab VM")

5. On the Connect to virtual machine blade, select **Download RDP File**, then open the downloaded RDP file.

   ![The Connect to virtual machine blade is displayed, and the Download RDP File button is highlighted.](./media/connect-to-virtual-machine.png "Connect to virtual machine")

6. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection Dialog Box, the Connect button is highlighted.](./media/remote-desktop-connection.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

7. Enter the following credentials when prompted, and then select **OK**:

   - **User name**: demouser
   - **Password**: Password.1!!

   ![The credentials specified above are entered into the Enter your credentials dialog.](media/rdc-credentials.png "Enter your credentials")

8. Select **Yes** to connect if prompted that the remote computer's identity cannot be verified.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states that the remote computer's identity cannot be verified and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is highlighted.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-labvm.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")
<!--
9. Once logged in, select the **Search** icon on the start bar, enter **default apps** into the search box, and select **Default apps** in the search results.

    ![The search icon is highlighted on the Windows start bar. In the search dialog, "default apps" is entered into the search box and highlighted. In the search results, Default apps is highlighted.](media/search-default-apps.png "Windows Search")

### Task 4: Download and install Power BI Desktop

Power BI desktop is required to make a connection to your Azure Synapse Analytics environment when creating the Power BI dashboard.

1. Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) on your VM.

You should follow all steps provided _before_ performing the Hands-on lab.

2. Install .Net 5 in the VM https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-5.0.408-windows-x64-binaries
3. https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-5.0.17-windows-x64-installer
